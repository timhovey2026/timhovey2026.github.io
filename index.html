    <p class="book-description">
      In the seaside town of Plymbury, where fog drifts in with the tide and
      secrets are passed down as carefully as heirlooms, magic lives quietly
      beneath the surface.
    </p>

    <p class="book-description">
      When long-buried truths begin to surface, one woman must reckon with the
      legacy she inherited and the power she never meant to claim.
      <em>The Plymbury Witch</em> is a story of memory, belonging, and the
      extraordinary hidden inside ordinary lives.
