            Nestled along the coast of Massachusetts sits the quaint town of Plymbury, steeped in history,
            tradition, and an undercurrent of magic.
          </p>

          <p class="book-description">
            Ravenna Greene is the latest to inherit the mystical Sea Glass Apothecary in this town where
            stars turned to glass and fell into the ocean. Local legend whispers that after centuries of tumbling,
            they’d be used to grant wishes by a witch with one green and one brown eye.
          </p>

          <p class="book-description">
            But when Pastor Chase Wilkinson arrives, he incites prejudice among the townspeople and a devastating
            fire that consumes the apothecary. With an unusable shop needing repair and nowhere else to go, Ravenna
            accepts a room in Chase’s church—with one caveat: no magic.
          </p>

          <p class="book-description">
            Now, caught between two worlds, Ravenna must navigate loyalty to her lineage and a growing attraction
            to Chase. Soon, she will face a heart-wrenching choice: love or magic.
          </p>

  <h3><b>A quick note from Kendra</b></h3>

  <p>You may notice this page looks a little different than it used to.</p>

  <p>I’m in the process of simplifying where and how I share my work, and that includes stepping away from selling
    books directly from my website. The story, however, remains the same — and <em>The Plymbury Witch</em> is still
    available everywhere books are sold.</p>

  <p>The button above will take you to a universal book page where you can choose your favorite retailer or format.</p>
